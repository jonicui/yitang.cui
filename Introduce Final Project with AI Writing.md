The growing mushroom consumption in Shanghai is an important issue to address because of the large amount of local citizens and the limited supply of local mushrooms. This highlights the importance of creating a sustainable food supply system that can meet the demands of citizens. My final project aims to create a mushroom grow box that can serve as a supplement of the local food supply system, helping to reduce carbon emission from coffee ground waste and food transportation. 

By implementing a green circulation system, this project can help to form multiple layers of ecological and economic benefits. It will not only reduce the environmental impacts from transportation and waste, but also help to provide food security and nutrition for citizens. Moreover, my project will contribute to the social impacts by promoting local economy and creating more job opportunities. 

What’s more, it aligns with the notion of ecosystem and bio-region strategy, in which sustainability is emphasized. The mushroom grow box will demonstrate how a circular economy could be applied in the real world and how it could work together with local resources to nourish the land. Ultimately, this project will create a holistic impact on both local citizens and ecosystems in Shanghai area, which is what I am striving for.
